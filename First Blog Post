# Why I decided to become a software developer

I decided to become a software developer because I wanted to find a career that challenges me, and makes me continue to learn and grow. Software development is interesting because you're solving problems, you can be creative, and you are doing something that is helping improve the world and its technical advances. I am excited to learn more about code and hope that it is something I will coninue to love doing.
